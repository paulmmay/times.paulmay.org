#Times Tools
Two tools that work with content from the Irish Times. One periodically saves the HTML from the front page and business page to a database for some unknown future use. 

Another function is an adaptation-in-progress of https://github.com/revdancatt/CAT540-guardian-picture-grid by Dan Catt that links to content on the Irish Times, rather than the Guardian. You can see it running at http://timesgrid.herokuapp.com
